            Please be aware that our wedding date may be subject to change based on the uncertain timing of the pandemic recovery.
            Unforunately, our wedding venue has not offered the option of postponing our date at this time. They are adhering to state
            guidelines which indicate our wedding would occur during the final recovery phase.
